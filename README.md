# Restaurant Reservation App

This .NET application is designed to facilitate restaurant reservations for users and management for restaurant owners. The app uses a SQL database to store and query restaurant and reservation information. It offers two primary user roles: **Client (User)** and **Admin (Restaurant Owner)**, each with unique functionalities. 

## Features

- **User Roles**:
  - **Client**: Allows users to search for restaurants, view available tables by date, and make reservations.
  - **Admin**: Enables restaurant owners to manage restaurant data, add or update restaurant details, and view reservation statistics.

- **Login and Sign-Up**:
  - Secure login and sign-up options with role-based access.
  - Sign up as either a **Client** or an **Admin**.

- **Restaurant Search with Map Integration**:
  - Search for restaurants by name using a database query.
  - Integrated Google Maps search through a web browser control for location-based searches.
  
- **Reservations**:
  - Select a restaurant, date, and view available tables.
  - Reserve a table, with the reservation details stored in the database.
  - Reservations occupy specific tables at specified dates to prevent double-booking.

- **Admin Management Tools**:
  - Add or edit restaurant details in the database.
  - Access restaurant-specific statistics to understand booking trends.
